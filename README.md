# irrBM
This tool has been created for the purpose of comparing how the same code used for GLSL can be
executed in C++.

The GLSL code used in the examples has been extracted from https://www.shadertoy.com and adapted by me to C++. The Irrlicht3D engine has been used to
generate the graphics in a simple and fast way. There are some examples that are very complex and consume a lot of resources, use them with caution!
